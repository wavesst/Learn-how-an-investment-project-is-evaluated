# Learn-how-an-investment-project-is-evaluated
<p>When considering disbursing part of our equity to place it in an investment, we must be cautious that the case requires.&nbsp;Many could be the years it took us to accumulate such capital as to make decisions lightly.&nbsp;That is why we must know how an investment project is evaluated, even if it is in a very general way.</p>
<p>It is true that, depending on the complexity of the proposal that accompanies the investment project, carrying out an evaluation of the profitability of the project will require the intervention of an expert (economist, accountant or related), but if we are entering the world of investments it is highly recommended to handle the rudiments of how to evaluate an investment.</p>
<p>How to evaluate an investment project: 2 fundamental questions</p>
<p>In any investment, the key question we must ask ourselves before making any determination is:&nbsp;<strong>is the project profitable?&nbsp;</strong>However, and although it seems obvious, this question is not always answered in the best way.&nbsp;Not enough with a hunch or intuition to dispatch this crucial question.&nbsp;<strong>You have to go to the numbers.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The key to starting an assertive investment evaluation is to&nbsp;<strong>be clear about the investment and cash flow that we expect to obtain</strong>.&nbsp;These figures must come from market studies, technical feasibility, organizational needs and any other factor involved.&nbsp;As you can see, the matter is not obvious.</p>
<p>These inputs should be resolved in the project preparation stage;&nbsp;In other words, the investor - or his financial advisor - should be able to have all those data that support the capital need of the project, as well as the estimated cash flows in each established period.</p>
<p>To begin to see clearly the quality of the project in terms of profitability we have to weigh what is called the&nbsp;<strong>Internal Rate&nbsp;of Return</strong>&nbsp;and, on the other hand, the&nbsp;<strong>Net Present Value</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;With these two values ​​we will be able to visualize whether it is worth advancing in the verification of the fundamentals of the project or if we leave our energies for something else.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</strong></p>
<p>This indicator is based on the estimated cash flows and shows us&nbsp;<strong>what is the rate that the investment gives us in the period of capital recovery</strong>.&nbsp;In other words, if an investment has an IRR of 15%, this means that given the estimates of income &ndash;or partial returns&ndash; that will be obtained within the period established to fully recover the capital, it would be necessary for those values ​​to be currently priced at fifteen %.</p>
<p>Let's look at the following example.&nbsp;Let us suppose that a project requires a one-time investment of 1000 euros, promising a return on capital in two years, also foreseeing that in the first year 550 euros will be obtained and in the second year 605 euros of income.</p>
<p>Given these conditions and doing the respective calculations, we see that the only way for this to be fulfilled is for the current values ​​of the sum of those future income to be estimated at a rate of 10%.&nbsp;It is then said that the investment has an IRR of 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Net present value</strong></p>
<p>This is another indicator that complements the vision that we can have of the chances of success of an investment.&nbsp;In this case, the same estimated income in the investment return period is considered, but&nbsp;<strong>the current rate is applied to determine the current value at the real rate.</strong></p>
<p>If that number rises above the investment (that is, the income that justifies the recovery of the capital has a greater present value than the investment), we will be facing a project that deserves our attention.&nbsp;Understanding this is essential to know how an investment project is evaluated.</p>
<p>In the case raised above, when applying the respective calculation to the values ​​indicated to be received according to the example, we observe that an amount of 1028 euros is obtained.</p>
<p>Since this amount is greater than the investment, we can conclude that it will be worthwhile to enter the project to now certify its viability.</p>
<p>How to evaluate a real estate investment</p>
<p>Evaluating a real estate investment does not escape these calculations that we have described.&nbsp;<strong>Considering the return on investment period and indexing the associated money flows are essential actions</strong>&nbsp;to make the decision.</p>
<p>The job of the promoters of the industry is precisely to provide all the data required so that investors can appreciate at a glance these figures, which are what will make them support or reject their real estate projects.</p>
